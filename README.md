# XP-Diablo-s-Serial-Monitor
Created for my personal use. This program will allow the user to send input and receive output from the Serial Ports. Added some other features that aren't necessary but good for my uses.

Has a few more features than the default Serial Monitor provided by Arduino's IDE.

## Features
- You can disconnect and reconnect to the serial port. Making it easier to compile and upload your code to your microcontroller without needing to close and reopen the window.
- You can pause your output if you need to look over the data that has been output.
- Changes the ports and baud rate automatically, as you switch between different ports and baud rates.

This program is free to use, and feel free to add improvments visually or other improvements in any other way.
